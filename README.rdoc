= Documentation

<b>The original +km+ Ruby gem is not thread safe.</b> We have released a new gem, {kmts}[https://github.com/kissmetrics/kmts], that is threadsafe.

We are hosting our documentation for our Ruby API here: https://support.kissmetrics.io/reference#ruby

= +kmts+ version 1.0.2

Version 1.0.2 of the +kmts+ gem had an issue where it was found to not actually be thread safe. If you were using version 1.0.2 of the +kmts+ gem, you were likely using non thread-safe code. In this case, you will want to either switch to using the non thread-safe +km+ gem, or update your code to use the thread-safe +kmts+ gem version >= 2.0.0.

= km version 1.2.0

This version uses the `trk.kissmetrics.io` tracking server domain.
